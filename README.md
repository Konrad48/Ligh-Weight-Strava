# Light-Weight-Baby-Strava-Renamer
Are you tired of boring Strava activity names like "Lunch Run" or "Evening hike"?

Well, look no further. This Google Apps Script automatically renames your Strava activities in [Ronnie Coleman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BNP126zgPU) style.

New activity name is a combination of words from two lists of strings. It avoids renaming the same activity more than once. Lists:
```javascript
const listOne = ["Oooh", "Yeah", "Yep", "Light Weight", "Pow", "Let's gooo", "Gotta get good", "Come on"];
const listTwo = ["Buddy", "Baby"];
```

## Steps to Set Up the Script

### 1. **Authenticate with the Strava API**

- Go to the [Strava Developers Portal](https://developers.strava.com/docs/getting-started).
- Create a new application and generate your API credentials.
- Obtain a `Bearer Token` by authorizing your application via OAuth 2.0 for API access. Importat, you'll need the following permissions: **read,activity:read,activity:write**

---

### 2. **Create the Script in Google Apps Script**

#### a. Create a New Google Apps Script Project

1. Go to [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com/).
2. Create a new project by clicking on **New Project**.

#### b. Add the Script Code

1. Copy the entire code from this repository into the editor.
2. Replace the placeholder `YOUR_STRAVA_BEARER_TOKEN` in the code with your Strava API Bearer Token.

```javascript
const accessToken = 'YOUR_STRAVA_BEARER_TOKEN';
```
#### c. Save the Script

### 3. Set Up the Hourly Trigger
The script includes a function createHourlyTrigger to set up a trigger for running the renameStravaActivitiesHourly function every hour.

1. In the Google Apps Script editor, select the createHourlyTrigger function from the dropdown.
2. Save the script

## Now you can flex with your perfectly named Strava activities üèÖ
